        <h2>When I'm Not Listening to Music</h2>
        
        <p>Honestly, I'm almost always listening to music... But when I need a break from my headphones, I enjoy visiting cat cafes, vinyl shopping, and playing piano (I'm way better at listening than playing). I also love watching video essays and documentaries on music and that give insight into artists' creative processes.</p>
                
        <h2>Let's Connect</h2>
        
        <p>I love connecting with other music enthusiasts, musicians, and anyone who's passionate about discovering new sounds.
